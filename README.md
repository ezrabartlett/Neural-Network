# Neural-Network

Very Simple neural network, with backpropogation and all. Biases are semi-broken.

Being pushed as-is, without much intent to add to this in the future. Created mostly as a project for my AI class, but has found its way into some personal projects of mine. Currently, it's set up to train itself on a set of characters from a font guide, then recognize characters even when noise is introduced into the bitmap.

If you want to run this for some reason, make sure you have python 3 and pip installed, then execute the following terminal commands.

	pip install -r requirements
	python NNProject.py
	
As always, I reccomend you set up a virtual environment, to avoid conflicts with your other python packages, and to mitigate the risk of world domination by this extremely sophisticated AI.
